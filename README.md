<h3> About this Application </h3>

This application consists of a music based subscription service. A user can login or create an account on the application, find a song based on either the artist name, the song title or the year the song was published. If they find a song that they like they can then store it in their personal area and keep track of their other subscriptions. 

<h3>Technologies Utilized Behind This Application</h3>

The project was made with React (Typescript + Bootstrap + Yarn) for the front-end and for the backend uses the AWS lambda + API Gateway. The database used to reterive music information and store user subscriptions is AWS DyanmoDB a NO-SQL database.

Amazon S3 Bucket is also used to store artist images and is used by the front end to reterive these respective images.

The whole application is hosted on AWS's EC2 instance with NGINX server.

<p> Unforunately, I cannot provide a direct link to my EC2 instance as I am bounded by AWS educational account which terminate EC2 instances after a certain period.</p>
